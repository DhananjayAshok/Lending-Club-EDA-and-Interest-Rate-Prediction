# Lending-Club-EDA-and-Interest-Rate-Prediction
The source code for the Kaggle notebook which covers an exploration and model comparison project on the Lending Club Loan Data.

The notebook includes exploratory data analysis and visualizations including but not limited to
1. Violin plots
2. Box Plots
3. Correlation Heatmaps
4. Etc.

We will then build different models using Scikit-Learn, once we have made the basic models (RandomForests, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines and more), we will attempt to make our models stronger using higher level techniques such as
1. Ensemble Learning Techniques
2. Boosting Techniques
